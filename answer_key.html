        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 1: H5N1 Avian Influenza</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is the primary reason public health officials are concerned about H5N1 avian influenza?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: C) The virus could mutate to enable efficient human-to-human transmission</div>
            <div class="explanation">The main concern is that H5N1 could mutate to allow efficient human-to-human transmission, potentially causing a pandemic. While current human cases are rare and usually linked to direct bird contact, influenza viruses can evolve rapidly.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 2: Mpox</div>
            <div class="question-text">What makes mpox a "re-emerging" infectious disease rather than a new disease?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) It has existed for decades but recently spread to new geographic areas</div>
            <div class="explanation">Mpox is considered re-emerging because it has been known since 1958 and was endemic in parts of Africa, but in 2022 it spread globally to regions where it had never been seen before, affecting new populations.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 3: Ebola</div>
            <div class="question-text">Which of the following is the most important factor in preventing Ebola transmission in healthcare settings?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Using proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control practices</div>
            <div class="explanation">Proper PPE and strict infection control practices are critical for preventing Ebola transmission in healthcare settings. Since Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, healthcare workers must use appropriate protective gear and follow rigorous protocols.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 4: COVID-19</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is one key reason why COVID-19 was able to spread so rapidly around the world compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks like SARS (2003)?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) People with COVID-19 can spread the virus before showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic transmission)</div>
            <div class="explanation">Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission made COVID-19 much harder to control than SARS. People could unknowingly spread the virus before feeling sick, making it difficult to identify and isolate cases early. With SARS, people were typically contagious only after becoming visibly ill.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 5: Dengue Fever</div>
            <div class="question-text">Why is dengue fever considered an emerging threat in new geographic regions?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Climate change and urbanization are expanding the range of mosquito vectors</div>
            <div class="explanation">Climate change is creating warmer temperatures in previously cooler regions, allowing Aedes mosquitoes to survive and breed in new areas. Combined with urbanization and increased travel, dengue is spreading to regions where it was previously uncommon or absent.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 6: Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is the primary cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis developing?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Patients not completing their full course of TB treatment</div>
            <div class="explanation">When patients don't complete their full course of TB treatment (which typically lasts 6-9 months for regular TB), some bacteria survive and can develop resistance to the drugs. This is why it's crucial for TB patients to take all their medications exactly as prescribed for the entire treatment period.</div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 1: H5N1 Avian Influenza</div>
            <div class="question-text">What animal is considered the natural reservoir for H5N1 avian influenza?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Wild aquatic birds (like ducks and geese)</div>
            <div class="explanation">Wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoir for avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. They can carry the virus without getting sick and spread it to domestic poultry through contact or contaminated water sources.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 2: Mpox</div>
            <div class="question-text">How is mpox primarily transmitted between humans?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Through close physical contact with infected individuals or contaminated materials</div>
            <div class="explanation">Mpox spreads through close contact with infected individuals, their lesions or scabs, bodily fluids, or contaminated materials like bedding. It requires close physical contact, unlike diseases that spread through the air over long distances.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 3: Ebola</div>
            <div class="question-text">Which animal is believed to be the natural reservoir host for Ebola virus?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Fruit bats</div>
            <div class="explanation">Fruit bats are believed to be the natural reservoir for Ebola virus. They can carry the virus without getting sick. Humans usually become infected through contact with infected bats or animals that have been infected by bats.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 4: COVID-19</div>
            <div class="question-text">What type of vaccine technology was used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: C) mRNA (messenger RNA)</div>
            <div class="explanation">The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA technology, which teaches cells to make a harmless piece of the spike protein that triggers an immune response. This was the first time mRNA vaccines were deployed at large scale for humans.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 5: Dengue Fever</div>
            <div class="question-text">How many distinct serotypes of dengue virus exist?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: C) 4</div>
            <div class="explanation">There are four distinct dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides lifelong immunity to that specific serotype, but only short-term immunity to the others. This is important because subsequent infections with different serotypes increase the risk of severe dengue.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 6: Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</div>
            <div class="question-text">Approximately how long does treatment for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) typically take?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: D) 18-24 months or longer</div>
            <div class="explanation">MDR-TB treatment typically takes 18-24 months or even longer, compared to 6-9 months for regular TB. The treatment is more complex, expensive, and involves medications with more serious side effects, making adherence challenging.</div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 1: H5N1 Avian Influenza</div>
            <div class="question-text">How do most human H5N1 infections occur?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments</div>
            <div class="explanation">Most human H5N1 cases result from direct contact with sick or dead infected poultry, or exposure to contaminated environments like live bird markets. The virus does not spread easily between people, and properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 2: Mpox</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is a key characteristic of the mpox rash?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) It progresses through multiple stages from macules to pustules to scabs</div>
            <div class="explanation">The mpox rash is distinctive because it progresses through several stages: flat spots (macules), raised bumps (papules), fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), pus-filled lesions (pustules), and finally scabs. This progression helps with diagnosis.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 3: Ebola</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is the typical incubation period for Ebola (time between infection and symptoms)?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) 2-21 days (average 8-10 days)</div>
            <div class="explanation">Ebola has an incubation period of 2-21 days, with symptoms typically appearing around 8-10 days after exposure. During the incubation period, people are not contagious - they only become infectious once symptoms develop.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 4: COVID-19</div>
            <div class="question-text">What does "R0" (R-naught) measure in infectious disease epidemiology?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) The average number of people one infected person will infect in a completely susceptible population</div>
            <div class="explanation">R0 (basic reproduction number) represents the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected person in a completely susceptible population. For COVID-19, variants have had different R0 values, with some variants being more transmissible than others.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 5: Dengue Fever</div>
            <div class="question-text">What time of day are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (the primary dengue vector) most active?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Early morning and late afternoon/evening</div>
            <div class="explanation">Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are most active during early morning (after dawn) and in the late afternoon/evening (before dusk). Unlike many other mosquito species, they bite during the day, which is why daytime mosquito protection is important in dengue-endemic areas.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 6: Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</div>
            <div class="question-text">What strategy helps ensure TB patients complete their treatment and prevents drug resistance?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: A) DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) where healthcare workers watch patients take their medicine</div>
            <div class="explanation">Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is a key strategy where healthcare workers or trained volunteers directly observe patients taking their TB medications. This ensures adherence to treatment, which is critical for cure and preventing the development of drug-resistant TB.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) It has a much higher mortality rate in humans who do get infected</div>
            <div class="explanation">While H5N1 rarely infects humans, when it does, the mortality rate is approximately 50%, much higher than seasonal flu which has a mortality rate below 1%. However, H5N1 does not currently spread easily between people.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 2: Mpox</div>
            <div class="question-text">Why did the WHO recommend changing the name from "monkeypox" to "mpox" in 2022?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) To reduce stigma and avoid discriminatory language</div>
            <div class="explanation">The WHO changed the name to mpox to reduce stigma and avoid discriminatory or racist language that emerged during the 2022 outbreak. The goal was to use a neutral, non-stigmatizing name for the disease.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 3: Ebola</div>
            <div class="question-text">Why is it especially important to handle deceased Ebola victims carefully?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Bodies of Ebola victims remain highly infectious and require safe burial practices</div>
            <div class="explanation">Ebola virus remains infectious in the bodies of deceased victims. Traditional burial practices involving washing and touching the body can lead to transmission. Safe burial practices by trained personnel are critical for controlling Ebola outbreaks.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 4: COVID-19</div>
            <div class="question-text">What is "long COVID"?</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">‚úì CORRECT ANSWER: B) Persistent symptoms or new health problems lasting weeks to months after initial COVID infection</div>
            <div class="explanation">Long COVID (also called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection or PASC) refers to persistent symptoms or new health problems that continue for weeks, months, or even longer after the initial COVID-19 infection. Symptoms can include fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, and many others.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="disease-name">Question 5: Dengue Fever</div>
